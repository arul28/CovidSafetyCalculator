# CovidSafetyCalculator
Sarvesh Somasundaram | Arul Sharma | Taha Haveliwala | Abdullah Shahid

We created a program that looks at various state data such as number of cases and number of available tests, and created a calculator that tells you whether or not it is safe to go outside.

## Instructions
Download all the files, including the .py file, the csv file, and the png files.
Open the code in an IDE, and make sure that you have the necessary libraries installed.
You will need to have the libraries tkinter and pandas.

Before you run the code, you will have to make sure the png files and the csv file are in the same folder as the .py file, so that the code can successfully call the images and csv file. It should already be together if you downloaded all the files together off of the GitHub. Don't rename any of the files, as the code needs the given name in order for it to run properly.

When you run this code, you will see a drop down menu where you can chose your state. After selecting your state, click accept to see details about the state, and the current situation of Covid-19.
All the data goes up to May 29, 2020.
